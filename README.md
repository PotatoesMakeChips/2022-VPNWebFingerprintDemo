## Dev Enviroment
First, get a MongoDB database setup, you may want to spin up a separate local version of MongoDB, or a free cluster server through Atlas. The only requirement for any database solution is that it is running MongoDB, and that the server has a connection to it.

Once you have successfully edited the .env file in api to match your database setup, run `npm install` to download all dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, simply run `npm run start:dev` to run an automatically reloading development server.
